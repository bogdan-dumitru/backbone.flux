backbone-flux
=============

### Prelude

After seeing the [Flux overview](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html), I couldn't contain my entusiasum so I started migrating the work I'm currently doing at Anyroad into React + Flux. The main project I'm migrating currently uses Backbone havily. 
My goal is to start abstracting the code when I start seeing patterns and include it here to validate my assumptions and maybe help others get started with Flux and React.
